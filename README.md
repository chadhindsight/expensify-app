# Indecision App

A project based on the React project in Ben Mead's React course availaible on Udemy. It is a Todo List built with react and SCSS athat allows a user to add a list of tasks and then have the app return one task from that list to them. 

## HOW IT WORKS

The user inputs a task in the input field and then submits to the list. They can also remove and add new items if they wish to.  

## Under The Hood
This app was built with React, React Modal, SCSS, and webpack.
